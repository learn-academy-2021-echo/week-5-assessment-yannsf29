# ASSESSMENT 5: Ruby Coding Practical Questions
# MINASWAN

# --------------------1) Create a method that takes in an array of words and a single letter and returns all the words that contain that particular letter.


letter_o = 'o'
# Expected output: ['coffee', 'soda water']
letter_t = 't'
# Expected output: ['tea', 'water', 'soda water']




def find_words_with_letter(array, string_letter)
  array.select { |word| word.include?(string_letter) }
end

p find_words_with_letter(beverages_array, letter_o)
p find_words_with_letter(beverages_array, letter_t)



# -------------------2) Create a method that takes in an array of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers. Use the test variables provided.
#
nums_array1 = [42, 7, 27]
# Expected output: 76

p nums_array1.inject(0){|sum,x| sum + x }

#
nums_array2 = [25, 17, 47, 11]
# Expected output: 100

p nums_array2.inject(0){|sum,x| sum + x }



# --------------------3a) Create a class called Bike that is initialized with a model, wheels, and current_speed. The default number of wheels is 2. The current_speed should start at 0. Create a bike_info method that returns a sentence with all the data from the bike object.
# Expected output example: 'The Trek bike has 2 wheels and is going 0 mph.'
# -------------------3b) Add the ability to pedal faster and brake. The pedal_faster method should increase the speed by a given amount. The brake method should decrease the speed by a given amount. The bike cannot go negative speeds.

# Expected output example: my_bike.pedal_faster(10) => 10
# Expected output example: my_bike.pedal_faster(18) => 28
# Expected output example: my_bike.brake(5) => 23
# Expected output example: my_bike.brake(25) => 0

class Bike
  attr_accessor :model, :wheels, :current_speed
  def initialize(model)
    @model = model
    @wheels = 2
    @current_speed = 0
  end
  def bike_info
    "The #{@model} bike has #{@wheels} wheels and is going #{@current_speed} mph."
  end
  def pedal_faster(speed_up)
    @current_speed += speed_up
  end
  def brake(slow_down)
    if @current_speed - slow_down <= 0
      @current_speed = 0
    else
      @current_speed -= slow_down
    end
  end
end

my_bike = Bike.new('Trek')
p my_bike.bike_info

# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer:

  In Ruby, blocks are snippets of code that can be created to be executed later. Blocks are passed to methods that yield them within the do and end keywords.

  Researched answer:

  Blocks are called closures in other programming languages. There are some important points about Blocks in Ruby: Block can accept arguments and returns a value. ... A block is always invoked with a function or can say passed to a method call. To call a block within a method with a value, yield statement is used



2. What is a gem?

  Your answer:

In Ruby, a gem is a library that contains a specific piece of functionality as well as any files or assets related to that functionality.

  Researched answer:

In Ruby, a gem is a library that contains a specific piece of functionality as well as any files or assets related to that functionality. Gems can be found for all sorts of common functionality in an application -- things like handling money and currency, integrating with credit card processing, tools to make ruby coding even easier, and more. You could write these things yourself but one big benefit to using a gem instead is that it saves time.  



3. What is Ruby on Rails?

  Your answer:
  Ruby on Rails is an open-source software used to build web applications

  Researched answer:

  Ruby on Rails is an open-source software used to build web applications. Rails is a framework used to create websites using the general-purpose programming language Ruby. Ruby ranks amongst the top ten programming languages predominantly because of the Voguishness of Rails.

  Ruby on Rails was built by David Heinemeier Hansson and is often just called “Rails”. It amalgamates Ruby with HTML, JavaScript and CSS to manufacture a web application that operates on a web server. It is generally considered to be a server-side web application development platform. Rails catalyzes the process of buildings complex sites. John Dillon, CEO of Engine Yard, said Ruby’s productivity in Rails is anywhere from 2 to 2.5 times greater than a comparable Java programmer.




4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer:
 it is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another

  Researched answer:

  A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. Relational databases are based on the relational model, an intuitive, straightforward way of representing data in tables. In a relational database, each row in the table is a record with a unique ID called the key. The columns of the table hold attributes of the data, and each record usually has a value for each attribute, making it easy to establish the relationships among data points.

5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer: it is a special column that hold database it is use to identify each data

  Researched answer:

  A primary key is a special relational database table column (or combination of columns) designated to uniquely identify each table record.

  A primary key is used as a unique identifier to quickly parse data within the table. A table cannot have more than one primary key.

  A primary key’s main features are:

 It must contain a unique value for each row of data.
 It cannot contain null values.
 Every row must have a primary key value.
 A primary key might use one or more fields already present in the underlying data model, or a specific extra field can be created to be the primary key.





## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes:

A RESTful route is a route that provides mapping from HTTP verbs (get, post, put, delete, patch) to controller CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete). Instead of relying solely on the URL to indicate what site to visit, a RESTful route depends on the HTTP verb and the URL.

2. JSON:

It is a text-based way of representing JavaScript object literals, arrays, and scalar data. JSON is relatively easy to read and write, while also easy for software to parse and generate. It is often used for serializing structured data and exchanging it over a network, typically between a server and web applications.



3. ERB:

ERB stands for Educational Records Bureau. The Educational Records Bureau is a not-for-profit organization which provides assessment and instructional services for K-12 schools. The Educational Records Bureau (ERB) creates and administers a number of tests, which are commonly referred to as "ERBs."



4. Params:


As you might have guessed, params is an alias for the parameters method. params comes from ActionController::Base, which is accessed by your application via ApplicationController. Specifically, params refers to the parameters being passed to the controller via a GET or POST request.




5. API:

What is an API? An Application Programming Interface is a set of code that governs the way software interacts with other software — it is the communication between the software that facilitates interaction.
